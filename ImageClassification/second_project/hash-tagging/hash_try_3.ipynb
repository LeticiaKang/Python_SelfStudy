    "Note that this code is just an example and may require modifications depending on the specifics of your dataset and use case. In the code, the VGG16 model is used as the base model, which is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned for hashtag prediction. The final layer of the model outputs a 100-dimensional vector, which represents the predicted probability of each of the 100 possible hashtags. You may change the number of possible hashtags to match the size of your hashtag vocabulary."
